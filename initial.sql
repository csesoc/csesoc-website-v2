INSERT INTO "pages_richtextpage" VALUES(1,'<p>CSESoc is the principal representative body for computing students on campus. We are one of the biggest and most active societies at UNSW, catering to approximately 1200 CSE students. We are here to fulfill the social needs of computing students and also promote computing in all its forms through weekly social and technical events throughout the year.</p>
<p>We are a society for the students, by the students. As a CSE student, here''s how we can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>We organise and run weekly events, including Trivia, Movie, Poker, and Boardgame Nights, LAN Parties, Workshops, Code Jams, Tech Talks, and our famous Free Weekly BBQ.</li>
<li>We run a highly successful First Year Camp, offering new CSE students (both undergraduate and postgraduate) a weekend of Trivia, Dance Parties, Scavenger Hunts and general frivolity with the chance to meet and mingle with other newcomers.</li>
<li>The society is entirely run by CSE student volunteers. All CSE Students are automatically members, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with running events and activities.</li>
<li>We cater to new and returning students alike, with a mix of events designed to have something for everyone. Events are open to all members and nearly all are free to attend.</li>
<li>We''re as passionate about computing as you are; we provide technical events to teach you new skills, as well as a fortnightly magazine to keep you updated on what''s new and interesting within the university, school and industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all, we''re here to help you settle in and have a great time at UNSW!</p>');
INSERT INTO "pages_richtextpage" VALUES(2,'<p>CSESoc was formed in October 2006 from the old CompSoc and SESoc societies. CompSoc helped represent the interest of students studying Computer Engineering, Computer Science and postgraduate courses, while SESoc was the representative body for Software Engineering students. Both societies provided technical and social support to their members. In the best interest of everyone, the societies merged to provide a better experience to all CSE students.</p>
<p>CSESoc now represents students enrolled in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Bioinformatics Engineering, or a post‐graduate program administered by CSE (research or coursework).</p>
<p>Even today CSESoc continues to be an integral part of the student experience. Many students make the most of their time at university by joining a working group in first year to get a taste of the society. If you are enthusiastic and interested you can nominate yourself or be nominated for a position in the Exec at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Being part of a society is a great way to meet new people and gain extra skills that employers look for in the industry.</p>

INSERT INTO "pages_richtextpage" VALUES(21,'<p>In the mystical and magical universe of University there exists many realms; and within these realms, factions. You, as a newcomer in this land have arrived in the realm of UNSW, joined with the faction of CSE. University is but a passage-way through to many other vast lands. As you travel onward to your chosen destiny, there are many sights to see and experiences to be had; some ignore the beauty and excitement and power through to their future, but the more adventurous, those who seek to make the most of their time in this wondrous world, seize every opportunity to explore their realm. This is a frightening and arduous task and is rarely attempted by a lone adventurer. Allies must be made.</p>

<p>Thus the leading group in the faction of CSE, CSESoc, brings to you the glorious ‘First Year Camp’ (this should be in large fancy text :P). This Camp is a joyous journey into the outer lands of this universe where participants shall stay in quaint huts with bedding. They shall gather in the Great Main Hall for gluttonous feasts and great trials of the mind and body. The many tasks asked of you and your brethren will spark a bond between all camp goers that will last longer than just your journey through this world. The weekend culminates in a fantastical night of donning your themed garments and flailing your limbs in time with our minstrels’ music.</p>

<p>This expedition shall leave you changed for eternity with a Fresh outlook on the unknown, yet awe-inspiring world of University and a band of new companions ready to help you tackle it.</p>

<h1>What is Murder@CSE?</h1>

<p>Murder is a really fun game that we often play as a society, especially when the frustrations and annoyances of semester start to build up.</p>

<p>You get a victim, and a password. Your job is to hunt down your victim and get their password. Easy enough, right? Enter their password on the murder site, and get a new victim. The winner is the one with the most kills at the end of semester</p>

<p>There''s some rules, though:
<ul>
<li>Murder is played on the Kensington campus of UNSW. No killing at home, folks</li>
<li>No killing in classes! This includes lectures, tutes, labs, consultations, seminars and anything else on a myunsw timetable. Lying in wait outside lecture halls is allowed (even encouraged)</li>
<li>No killing at CSESoc events
</p>

<a href=/murder>Sounds good, let''s play</a>');
